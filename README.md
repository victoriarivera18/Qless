# Qless
Qless started off as an app idea to give real time data on wait times at dining location on campus. I came up with it in order to help saves student time throughout their day-to-day. Through Engineering Inc. at Texas A&amp;M, my team and I have the opportunity to develop our idea and hopefully bring it to market one day. I made this repository for documentation purposes.
