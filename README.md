# Qless
Qless started off as an app idea to give real time data on wait times at dining location on campus. I came up with it in order to help saves student time throughout their day-to-day. Through Engineering Inc. at Texas A&amp;M, my team and I have the opportunity to develop our idea and hopefully bring it to market one day. I made this repository for documentation purposes.

8/13/2020 - Qless has been put on an indefinite hold due to COVID-19's impact of the Fall 2020 semester. All members of the team hope to be ale to resume work on this project in the future.
